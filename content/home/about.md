# 

I am a Ph.D student at the Jackson School of Geosciences, UT Austin. I am advised by [Dr. Mrinal Sen](https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/researcher/mrinal_sen/). I am also affiliated with the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics. I enjoy developing accurate and efficient solutions to real world problems using mathematical physics. Currently my research focuses on solving forward and inverse problems in exploration geophysics. I have been lucky to work with wonderful [researchers]({{< ref "post/getting-started.md" >}}).



Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13C5BphSxtNzRgDlMJGrsY4mrEYreTcYU)
